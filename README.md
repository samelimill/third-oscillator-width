# Password Generator

## Description

In this project, I've constructed a password generator using Javascript.
The generator works as follows:
<li>On clicking the 'Generate Password' button, the user is provided a series of popups to select criteria for the password.</li>
<li>The page provides a series of confirmations for the user to select what type of characters they would like to inlude in their password.</li>
<li>The page provides a prompt for the user to select a character length for their password.</li>
<li>If the user fails to select characters, or selects a length outside of the acceptable range, the user is alerted to the error and are able to try again.</li>
<li>If all criteria are appropriately met, the page generates a string according to the selected criteria.</li>

In building this project, I gained a newfound understanding of the possibiliies of user interaction, and feel that I've gained a more significant understanding of methods, variables, and scope in Javascript.

The HTML and CSS remain unchanged, as does the appearance of the site:
